Programming Assignment
A furlong is a module of distance equal to 220 yards (1/8 mile). 
Write two classes that implement distances in the following manner:

The first class keeps track of distances as a whole number of furlongs, 
a whole number of yards, and a number of feet, which may have a fractional component.

The second class keeps track of distances as a whole number of kilometers, 
followed by a number of meters, which may have a fractional component.

Implement conversions between the two classes, ensuring that conversion 
in both directions is possible.

Allow the user to enter in the two types of distances and then display 
the conversions for each entry:

Furlongs, yards and feet Kilometers and meters
Note that the internal view of the data is entirely up to you,
 but the logical view must match the specifications above. 
 Also note that the emphasis of this assignment is on the use of 
 conversions. Exhaustive implementations of these classes are 
 therefore not required. The ability to declare, output, 
 and convert constitute the essential elements. 
 The program should still consist of at least three modules,
 a driver module containing main(), and the xxx.h and xxx.cpp 
 modules containing the function/class prototypes and definitions.
